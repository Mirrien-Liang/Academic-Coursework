# Question 4

# Three benefits:
# Because the method doesn't require the data to be labeled,
# it is frequently utilized in a variety of real-world problem statements.
# K-means clustering is easy to implement.
# The approach can handle massive amounts of data.


# Three drawbacks:
# The value of K must be manually selected.
# Outliers would have an adverse impact on the clustering.
# Clusters cannot overlap: one point can only belong to one cluster at a time,
# leading to certain points placed in incorrect clusters.
